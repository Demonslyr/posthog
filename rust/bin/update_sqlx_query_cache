# for more details. *IMPORTANT* you should generally run this only if you've
# already run `posthog/rust/bin/migrate_tests`, and have since made changes
# to SQLX queries in the code that are wrapped by `sqlx::query*!(...)` macros

# Docker Compose rig, and (if `bin/migrate_tests` has been run!) will

# when refreshing the SQLX query cache at `posthog/rust/.sqlx`
